Copy the Application directory to: 
~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Project Templates/AppleTV

Now, when you create a new project in Xcode you will have an option for AppleTV Application.

After you create a new ATV application using this template, you must set the IP or hostname
of your apple tv in the target's build setting under ATV_ADDRESS.

This bundle is derived from Michael Gile's work:

If you modify this template and would like to update your system's template, run: 
./update_template
